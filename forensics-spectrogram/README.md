## Steps​
#### Step 1
If you open up the audio file, it doesn't sound like anything useful (and it's not). From the challenge title, you should be able to determine that there may be information hidden in the audio's [spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram).

#### Step 2
If you open the spectrogram in a program like [Sonic Visualizer](https://sonicvisualiser.org/screenshots.html) or Audacity, you should be able to make out the flag: `utflag{sp3tr0gr4m0ph0n3}`.
